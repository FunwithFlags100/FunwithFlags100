Hello, FunwithFLags here and if you know the reference then cheers! I am new to the programming world as I am a student in university in CS and currently also learning 
through the wonderful odin project. I have long had a desire to learn programming and computer science topics in general and I finally pulled the trigger. I hope to learn
as much as I can, and create projects that are innovative, challenging, and most importantly fun!!!
